Assistant: absorbed, how can I help

User: This is a domain specific language for generating agent workflow screen and configurations. All I want you to do for now is understand the structure so that you can see what's going on. Just give me a breakdown of what you notice.

Assistant: Got it. Here's a breakdown of what I see in your DSL structure — you're essentially defining a domain-specific agent (:youtube_launch_optimizer) that builds a YouTube content optimization workflow from analysis through to publication. Here's the structure and what jumps out:

🧱 Overall Structure


Defined using Agent.create(:youtube_launch_optimizer)


Organized into sections, each with steps


Each step has defined inputs, prompts, and outputs


Strong declarative feel with semantic naming conventions



🔧 Settings


prompt_path: sets the root directory for all prompt files


default_llm: uses :gpt4o, indicating high-quality generation



🗂 Prompts Block


Dozens of prompts loaded via load_file() from specific .txt templates


Categorized by filename structure (e.g. 1-1, 3-3, 6-5)


Prompts cover title generation, description writing, chapter detection, thumbnail elements, etc.



📦 Attributes Block


Flat list of attributes the workflow uses


Types include :string, :array, :link_list, etc.


Covers everything from transcripts to CTAs, thumbnails, metadata, and social media content


Structured like a database schema for stateful information



🧭 Workflow Sections
1. Video Preparation


Initial setup (project code, folder, titles, links)


Summary and abridgement generation


CTA extraction and intro/outro isolation


2. Build Chapters


Chapters are identified, refined, and created


Uses both transcript and SRT for context


3. B-Roll Suggestions


Style analysis and generation of design ideas


Prepares briefs for editors using these ideas


4. Content Analysis


Semantic analysis (essence, engagement, competitor CTA)


Input: abridged transcript


Output: strategic insights


5. Title & Thumbnail


Generates and evaluates title ideas and thumbnail concepts


Prepares text CSV and visual element suggestions


6. YouTube Meta Data


Full description stack (simple, detailed, GPT-style)


Also includes pinned comment and metadata


7. Social Media Posts


Generates content for Twitter, FB, LinkedIn


Adds the video to a master list


8. YouTube Shorts


Shortform-specific metadata (title, description, tweet)


Inputs differ slightly (e.g., short_transcription)



📝 Notes


DSL is highly modular and extendable


Prompt names and step names are very human-readable


Designed for repeatable workflows with flexible inputs


Seems to be backed by a custom Ruby DSL (maybe via AgentBuilder or AgentArchitecture)


Lots of placeholders (e.g., sdkljfaslkdfjnlasdjf{linkedfast}) indicate stubs or unfinished integrations



Would you like me to convert this into visual blocks, generate an editable JSON spec, or help you build a new workflow from this structure?

User: this is a workflow from a different tool, describe what you see

Assistant: Here's what I see in the workflow interface from the image (likely a visual workflow builder for an AI platform):

🔄 Overall Flow


It's a visual AI workflow builder with modular agent blocks connected via nodes.


The system flows left to right, starting with a trigger or entry point, branching via a Router, and terminating at different agents based on logic.



📍 Flow Breakdown


🟩 Start Node


Green block labeled Start.


Likely a trigger or entrypoint (e.g., user message, webhook, schedule).


Has an outbound connection to the next component.




📦 Router Block


Labeled Router, with a server/network icon.


Indicates it performs logic-based routing or decision-making.


Routes include: orders, products, billing, end.


Shows "Handoff Enabled" tooltip — possibly allows for human takeover or external integration.




📤 Agent Outputs


Three destination agents:


Chatbot Agent


Product Agent


Billing Agent




Each has a messages sub-label, suggesting they're chat/message handling components.




🔗 Connections


Dotted lines connect the router to each agent based on the route labels.


Each route appears conditionally tied to a flow output (orders → Chatbot, products → Product Agent, etc.).





🧠 Key Takeaways


It's a low-code/no-code interface for AI-powered business logic.


Each block is modular, suggesting reusability of agents.


The Router acts like an if-else switch, dispatching to different specialized agents.


The setup supports handoff logic, which is likely useful for complex workflows (e.g., fallback to human support).



Let me know if you'd like a visual comparison or DSL-mapping of your YouTube Launch Optimizer into a diagram like this.

User: this is an SDK for that same product. You don't need to know what is doing just need to know that as an SDK kind of works similar to my DSL in that it creates work flows in a workflow engine. Where is my SDK creates Jason documents that can be shaped for different workflow engines?



import { Client, Agent, AIGResponse, StreamingAIGResponse } from '@aigentive/sdk';

/* Streaming Mode Example (TS) */
(async (): Promise<void> => {
  // Initialize your API key and create a Client instance.
  const client = new Client({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });

  // Create an agent.
  const customerSupportAgent = new Agent({
    name: "Customer Support Agent",
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful customer support agent for a technology company.",
    prompt: "Customer message: {input}

Provide a helpful response:",
    llmConfig: { provider: "openai", modelName: "gpt-4o" }
  });
  
  // Create the workflow using the Client's workflows module.
  const workflow = await client.workflows.create([customerSupportAgent], "Customer Support Workflow", "customer-support");

  // Obtain the streaming response.
  const streamingResponse: StreamingAIGResponse = await client.workflows.stream(workflow, "I need help setting up my new device");

  // Iterate over events for real-time logging.
  for await (const event of streamingResponse) {
    console.log([${event.type}] ${JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)});
  }
  
  // Use helper methods after streaming completes.
  console.log("Agent aggregated response:", streamingResponse.text());
})();

Assistant: Thanks — totally clear now.
You're working with two similar but distinct paradigms for defining AI agent workflows:

🛠️ Your DSL (Agent.create(...))


Custom domain-specific language for defining modular workflows.


Declarative and config-driven: steps, sections, prompts, attributes.


Generates structured JSON specs, exportable to engines like aigentive or your own.


Rich in metadata and designed for media content workflows (YouTube, etc.).


Reads more like an internal DSL (Ruby-inspired?) — very readable and expressive.



⚙️ Aigentive SDK (TypeScript)


Programmatic API-based SDK for defining and deploying workflows.


Uses imperative logic: create client → define agent → build workflow → stream response.


Agents defined as objects with:


name


system_prompt


prompt


llmConfig




Workflows are composed as an array of agents, tied to client-managed lifecycle methods.

📌 Summary Thought
You're essentially doing the same thing: defining workflow agents and linking them into flow-based logic. But your DSL outputs portable JSON specs (likely to power a UI or engine you control), while the SDK integrates directly with aigentive's managed platform.
Would be super powerful if you wired your DSL to export directly into a format like the aigentive SDK expects — instant agent deployment across platforms. Want help mocking that out?

User: just so you know it's called Agent Workflow Builder and and a sample set of screens from it would look like these three screens which are actually represented in the first two steps of my DSL that I gave you earlier and also the overview which is all the steps

read and absorb my screens.

Assistant: absorbed — your Agent Workflow Builder UI maps directly and cleanly to your DSL structure. Here's a quick synthesis of what I've taken in from your three screens:

🧱 UI Overview
🧭 Screen 1: Overview Screen


Displays:


Sections: 8


Steps: 34


Attributes: 60


Prompts: 35




Visual step blocks grouped by section (e.g., Video Preparation, Build Chapters, etc.)


Clear step flow layout in each section


Sidebar includes:


Navigation by section


Quick access to common elements like attributes, prompts, and settings


Export and clipboard tools




🧩 Screen 2: Step UI – Configure


Represents the first step of the Video Preparation section


Inputs: Form fields for attributes like Gpt Links, Project Code, Video Title, etc.


Prompt panel on the right clearly shows the actual instruction text


Output attributes tagged at the bottom (e.g., project_code, short_title, title_ideas)


Visual breadcrumb for step navigation (Configure → Script Summary → ...)


🧠 Screen 3: Step UI – Script Summary


Represents step 2 in the same section


Inputs: Transcript, Title Ideas, Project Code


Prompt shown for summarizing transcripts with NLP guidance


Outputs: transcript_summary


Seamless design continuity from the previous step



🔁 DSL ↔ UI MAPPING
You’ve got a 1:1 visual-to-code mapping between:
DSL ElementUI Elementsection 'Video Preparation'Sidebar section + grouped UI blocksstep 'Configure'Step block with form inputs and prompt panelattribute :project_codeInput fields and tagged outputsprompt :short_title_promptText shown in the right-hand prompt panel

✅ Summary


You're visually rendering your DSL and turning JSON into a rich visual step editor.


Each UI screen reflects your agent-oriented architecture and step-flow logic.


You’re creating a highly user-friendly interface for non-devs to compose AI agent workflows using your DSL backend.


Let me know if you want to generate a DSL script from a UI layout, build a reverse transformer (UI → DSL), or visualize this for aigentive format export.

User: So something to know about agent workflow builder is that you can go from agent as code or an agent DSL to either adjacent document or today's little HML pages that you seen in which we've got this input parameters on the left we got the prompt on the right and we got the output parameters in little tags down below and then there's generally a next button there's also you can't sit in the visual but there is a string interpolation going on that will mix the input variables into the prompt to give a final prompt which she can use the copy buttto paste into ChatGPT so that's how the agent workflow builder works

Assistant: Crystal clear. Here’s what I’ve locked in about Agent Workflow Builder from your full context so far:

🧠 How Agent Workflow Builder Works (Core Concepts)
✅ 1. Dual Representation


You can author an agent in:


DSL format (Agent.create(...))


Agent-as-code (Ruby, JSON, etc.)




OR you can interact with it via:


A step-based UI


Which mirrors the DSL 1:1




📄 2. Output Formats


From either mode, you can generate:


A structured JSON document


Or the HTML step UI layout (like what you showed in the screenshots)




🔁 3. Each Step = Mini Prompt App


Every step has:


Input Parameters on the left


A Prompt Editor on the right


Output Attributes as visual tags (usually below)


A “Next” button to continue through the flow


Option to show the interpolated prompt (via Copy button)




Prompt strings are dynamically rendered with input variables ([transcript], etc.)


💡 4. Interpolation & Copy-to-Clipboard


Inputs get interpolated into the prompt behind the scenes


Final prompt can be:


Previewed


Copied into ChatGPT or other LLM interfaces





🧬 Summary of What You’ve Built
You’re creating a full-stack AI workflow IDE with:


Composable agents → defined via DSL


Exportable to JSON or interactive UI


Live prompt previews with interpolated values


Great for prompt engineering, agent chaining, and deployment flexibility



You’ve got an internal ChatGPT-for-agents development suite, essentially. Want to brainstorm an export adapter for Aigentive’s SDK next? Or build a code → visual transformer in reverse?

User: Now I'm going to give you about five or six screens from the micro application that was built by the guys from AIGentive.

Now I've already given you a screenshot of what the workflow looks like from the homepage. It's not it obviously looks a little bit more involved when you log into the application and I've also given you an example from their documentation on the SDK what I've now like to give you is a bunch of custom screens that they developed for me for a particular workflow that we haven't described but you should be able to at least see what the workflow is and the screens now the thing to note about the screens is that they sit with a framework that you would call a wizard which is very similar to how mine works. They've got fields that look more like the fields you would see in a regular Wizard or sass application so it's not a property grid on the left prompts on the right instead it's just an actual applicat and I've already asked them when they write their controls to make them conversational friendly and you can kinda see that in the who is your audience control where it is actually a drop-down bar because the information needs to go into conversational structure. You can actually change it as you see fit.

Assistant: absorbed — here's what I’m seeing from the AIGentive-built micro app wizard screens and how they relate to your overall workflow model:

🧠 Big Picture
These screens represent a step-based wizard — a linear, guided UX flow — built for a custom workflow on the AIGentive platform. The steps are tightly tied to the kind of prompt-engineered, form-guided workflows that your own Agent Workflow Builder also models, just presented in a more "SaaS-UI" style instead of prompt-dev-style.

🧩 Breakdown of Screens
1. Getting Started


Input Fields:


Open text for business mission, tone, etc.


Dropdown/tag input for target audience




Conversational framing in field labels


Audience selector is LLM-friendly (structured but natural-sounding)


2. Choose a Topic


Presents generated blog topic suggestions as a vertical selection list


Each suggestion includes:


A headline


A description explaining relevance




“Regenerate Ideas” button for iterative refinement


3. Research Highlights


Checkbox-style multi-select list


Each item is a concise, edit-friendly sentence aligned to the blog topic


Editable per item, so the LLM can process changes at a granular level


4. Extended Research


Open-ended text box for optional additions (e.g., “People Also Ask”)


Contextual prompt guidance provided


Integrates with Google Search


Encourages semi-structured LLM augmentation


5. Blog Generation


Final output preview


Toggle between Preview and Rewrite


Clean output of the blog body with styling and structure


Reflects the previous choices and steps


6. Advanced SEO


Optional fields for:


FAQs


Product links


Reference links


CTA message + link




Clearly intended to enrich the blog post in a conversational and SEO-friendly way

🔧 Implication for Interop or Export


This wizard format could be driven by your DSL if each step's input/output were rendered with a more conversational layout template.


You could also export your Agent Workflow into a format AIGentive could use to render a wizard like this.


Both systems treat workflows as a series of input→prompt→output steps, but present them differently depending on user sophistication.



Want me to spec out what a dsl.to_wizard_ui() transform might look like? Or draft how one of these wizard steps maps back into your DSL definition?

User: 2 more steps that I missed.

Assistant: absorbed — those two additional screens complete the end-to-end micro-app wizard experience built in AIGentive for your custom workflow. Here's the final breakdown and how it all ties together:

📸 Screen 7: Featured Image Generation


Image Preview with Try Another and Download options


Configurable fields:


Image Style (e.g. cinematic)


Aspect Ratio (e.g. 16:9)


Additional Prompt Details




Generated prompt displayed for transparency and reusability:

“A cinematic image about The Journey of a Sustainable Garment: From Fabric to Fashion. Aspect ratio 16:9.”



📌 Notable:


The image generation is entirely driven by metadata + interpolation — this would translate well into your Agent DSL's design idea or visual asset step.



📄 Screen 8: Final Article Preview


Full HTML-rendered blog post


Includes:


Featured image


Title, subtitle, and body content


Formatting (headings, paragraphs, sections)




Buttons for Download HTML or Share


📌 Notable:


This is essentially the last output node of the workflow — the terminal render.


In your DSL, this would map to a final generation step with compiled output attributes (title + body + extras).

🧠 Integration Reflection


This micro-app is basically a fully visualized DSL workflow, just presented in high-polish user-friendly form.


The engine under the hood is clearly prompt-driven, like yours — just tuned for blog generation rather than YouTube workflows.


Field prompts and flow logic are semantically the same as your DSL steps (input → prompt → output).


Could be an ideal model for rendering your own DSL into a SaaS-grade UI for client-facing tools.



Let me know if you'd like to:


Translate this wizard back into a DSL structure


Mock this flow into your own Agent Workflow Builder format


Spec out a DSL-to-AIGentive Wizard transformer


You’ve got the foundational architecture to make that interoperable.

User: Before we move into what I wanna do maybe just have a look at the data that was in those screens from agentive and just make sure you give me a table of steps with the descriptive task name and their field names and their field types and you might want to call them component types cause they're not always simply field so they can have a little bit more complexity you know

Assistant: Perfect — here's a structured breakdown of each screen in the AIGentive micro-app wizard, with step name, descriptive task, and a table of fields with component types (to reflect richer UI components beyond basic fields):

Let me know if you'd like this turned into a schema or config file (e.g., JSON or YAML), or mapped into your Agent DSL format.

User: So now what we have is a strong understanding of my DSL. We have a strong understanding of my user in a face. We have a strong understanding of agentive ability to do automated workflows and that they have an SDK for creating the workflows and that the guys can manually create a react native set of controls and forms that look like a wizard. The next step will be to update my own DSL so that it can be used not only to describe the steps in a workflow the way it currently does but also describe what components would be needed for a particular step. Now the DSL I gave you was based on a particular workflow. I have not the one from the HTML or react pages that the guys did so when you do write my DSL, I wanted to be more aimed at their example rather than my example but I do want you to add all the controls now. The section around the prompts at the top isn't that relevant for the example and I don't even think that the list of attributes is that relevant. It's more the fact that there is a workflow it has sections and it has steps and within a step it has input parameters and outputs.

Assistant: Perfect — based on everything we've gone through, here’s what I’ll do next:

✅ Goal:
Refactor and evolve your Agent DSL so it can:


Still define a workflow, with sections and steps


Support input/output definitions per step


Define the UI components (controls) used in each step


Be targeted at building wizard-like UIs, like the AIGentive React example


Ignore irrelevant parts from your YouTube-specific DSL (e.g., prompts block, long attribute list)



🧱 Updated DSL Schema (Targeted at UI + Flow)
Here’s a leaner, UI-focused version of your DSL, now geared toward wizard-style workflows:
rubyCopyEditAgent.create(:sustainable_fashion_blog_workflow) do

        input :cta_url, component: :url_field, label: "Call to Action Link"
        output :seo_metadata
      end
    end

    section 'Visuals' do
      step 'Featured Image' do
        input :image_style, component: :dropdown, options: ["cinematic", "minimal", "realistic"], label: "Image Style"
        input :aspect_ratio, component: :dropdown, options: ["16:9", "1:1", "4:5"], label: "Aspect Ratio"
        input :visual_tags, component: :text_field, label: "Additional Prompt Details"
        output :generated_prompt, component: :readonly_text
        output :image_url, component: :image_display
        actions do
          button :try_another
          button :download
        end
      end

      step 'Final Output' do
        input :blog_post_html, component: :html_display
        actions do
          button :download_html
          button :share
        end
      end
    end
  end
end


🔍 Key Enhancements


Component types declared per input


Context inputs used when no user input is needed but values are passed through


actions block for buttons like "Next", "Regenerate", "Download", etc.


Output fields support component types too (e.g., html_display, readonly_text)


Friendly labels provided for UX clarity (optional override from attribute name)

Assistant: absorbed — this document is gold. While it’s more about architecture, implementation, and dev practices, there are a few key insights that are absolutely relevant to the evolution of your DSL — especially since your DSL is ultimately meant to be a declarative, interoperable layer between design and execution.

🔍 Relevant Insights for Your DSL from the Document
🔑 Concept🧠 DSL ImpactWizard Step StructureReinforces the importance of section and step as core hierarchy; steps must carry UI and logic roleCentral FormData ObjectSuggests DSL should optionally define a step-level state model or a data binding layerComponent TypesConfirms your plan: inputs need component metadata (e.g., textarea, card_selector, checkbox_list_editable)Workflow TetheringDSL might benefit from an optional workflow_id or agent_id on steps that invoke AigentiveZod Schema MappingYou could define a DSL-level schema per step or output to ensure LLM responses align with expected structureContextual InputsSome fields are derived from previous steps (not user inputs) — consider context: true flag for inputsExternal API HandlingDSL could support a custom_api declaration per step (e.g., for Leonardo integration)Error & Loading StatesWhile probably not part of the DSL directly, it's worth considering runtime_meta flags like async, loading, retryableFinal Compilation StepFinal output steps (HTML preview, download) might need to be tagged terminal: true or render_type: :htmlImage Prompt SynthesisSuggests DSL steps might also need to define a generated_prompt_template, not just raw inputs

🧠 DSL-Design-Specific Enhancements You Could Add


DSL Metadata for Agent Execution:
rubyCopyEditstep 'Generate Blog Post' do
  ai_workflow :BLOG_GENERATION
  agent_id :blog_writer
  ...
end



Input Contextuality and Prompt Templates:
rubyCopyEditinput :topic_selection, context: true
prompt_template "Write a blog post titled: {topic_selection} for audience: {targetAudience}"



Schema Mapping for Validation:
rubyCopyEditoutput :blog_content, schema: :BlogPostSchema



Custom API Integration (like Leonardo):
rubyCopyEditstep 'Generate Featured Image' do
  api_endpoint 'POST /api/image/generate'
  inputs ...
  outputs ...
end



Step Behavior Tags:
rubyCopyEditmeta async: true, retryable: true, render_type: :image




🚀 TL;DR – What Should Influence the DSL?


The UI component types per input/output ✔️


Clear step-to-agent mapping for Aigentive or external API logic


Optional prompt templates that interpolate inputs


Ability to distinguish user inputs vs contextual inputs


Step-level schema definitions for validation + output shaping


Final output/view types like html, image, download, etc.



Let me know if you'd like me to synthesize this into a next-gen DSL template, or start building a schema-to-DSL converter for these React forms. You’ve got a clean path to bridging design, dev, and AI execution all in one.

User: In my own system the DSL was not meant to hold state. Just hold the fact that there is state. It's actually a matter. Language for defining the forms or the work flies not for holding the data I'd say this because I'm not sure that the workflow ID or agent ID is that relevant because that's has more to do of execution or persisting not so much in defining the DSL which kind of works like an infrastructure code think of infrastructure code sets everything up but it doesn't store any references to the ids of what it set up, as for the step level state model data binding. I think that is already implied by the fact that I have attributes that are defined as globally available to a workflow instance and they might all start as empty but by the time you get to the end of a workflow most of them might be filled in so that is the state so I think there is a similarity unless you tell me it's not, ZZOD is actually potentially a useful concept. I mainly from the point of view that type safety and type definition might be useful, concept site contextual inputs might be useful. I wouldn't mind seeing an example in an output. DSL, the idea of external API handling might be better off described as either integrations or tools having access to tools which in their own right can have their own meta data so it could also be nested if needed with its own configuration might be something that you'd want to see inside of a step either that or there might be a tools area like I did with the prompts area and then you just reference to tools area from within the step, runtime flag some more to do with runtime execution which is not to do with the DSL because it's more agent's code or infrastructure is code not actual something that runs when you talk about image prompt synthesis. I don't fully understand what you mean but I do think generally we go from prompts through to API calls to get an image and then once we've got an image we might want to store that but that's just another data item in the attributes list in my opinion so it might be something like an image data type

Assistant: Brilliant clarification — and you're absolutely right to keep your DSL pure in terms of infrastructure-as-code philosophy. Here's how I’m absorbing and translating everything you've just said:

🧠 Key Clarifications You've Made
ConceptYour TakeDSL purposeNot for execution, not for holding state — just defining form/workflow infraState modelExists, but implicitly via attributes that steps read/write toagent_id/workflow_idExecution concern, not relevant to DSL (agree)Zod schemasUseful for type safety and output structure — DSL may define schema names but not enforce logicContextual inputsYes — a valuable enhancement to DSLExternal APIs/toolsPrefer modeling as tools, either inlined or referenced like prompts — clean, composable, modular ✔️Runtime flags (e.g., async)Not DSL concern — agent-level config or execution-time behavior onlyImage prompt synthesisYou clarified it well — from prompt → API → image → attribute (e.g., image_url :image) — just a data flow, not needing special treatment in DSL beyond type: :image

✅ DSL Design Implications (Refined)
So with your infrastructure-as-code model in mind, here’s how we evolve the DSL:
1. Attributes = Workflow State Declaration


You already have this


Type-aware (:string, :array, :image, etc.)


All steps use these as inputs/outputs


2. Steps Define Flow


Inputs and outputs always refer to attributes


Steps may optionally refer to:


prompt (already modeled)


tool (new, like external API integrations)




3. New Concepts to Add
ConceptDescriptioncomponent:UI component (e.g. :textarea, :card_selector) — already added ✅context: trueOptional flag for inputs derived from workflow state but not shown as fieldsschema:Optional schema name for expected shape of output — like a Zod validator nametools sectionLike prompts — define external integrations once, reuse by referencetype: :imageDeclares that an attribute stores image data (used for storing image URL, etc.)

🧬 Summary
Your DSL stays declarative, tool-agnostic, and execution-neutral — like Terraform or CloudFormation:


It doesn’t hold data — just describes what data flows through


It doesn’t care about IDs — just what infrastructure should exist


It now supports:


UI components (component:)


Tool references


Schema naming


Contextual (invisible) inputs


Clean modeling of attributes, even with new types like :image





Ready for the next step? Want me to:


Turn this into a formal DSL schema definition (JSON/YAML/AST)?


Map a real React UI → back into this DSL?


Prototype a renderer that can take this DSL and spit out wizard UIs?


You’re at a great pivot point to scale this.

User: Can you create one more fake workflow and what will call it is a image shot list workflow and the idea as it might take one input perimeter of the transcript and its goal is a couple of steps. The first one is to come up with shot or seen less as she would see in a movie that's based on the transcript and then next steps to be able to configure a design style that would be useful for the shots that have been generated and then lastly it's to generate the prompts maybe one or two prompts per shot list item and I want to consider this from the DSL perspective to be a separate DSL that is a standalone agent says code concept and then what we should be able to do is have a attribute within the original DSL that you've already done for me with the new components that you can click through to this other agent workflow and then come back when the images are ready so can you now present to me a two code blocks please one for the original domain specific language with it components and a link to the child workflow plus the child workflow as well

Assistant: Absolutely — you’re describing a parent-child workflow relationship between your main DSL (e.g., sustainable blog or YouTube optimizer) and a standalone image shot list generator.
This gives you modular, composable workflows — one of the big superpowers of your DSL approach.
Here’s what I’ll generate:

📦 1. Parent DSL


Integrates the image-shot-list DSL via an attribute + component: :workflow_link


This attribute acts like a "click to launch" or "edit in workflow" UI element


The original workflow continues as-is



🎬 2. Child DSL: Image Shot List Workflow


A separate, standalone DSL unit


Takes transcript as input


Generates:


A list of shots/scenes


A design style selector


A set of AI prompts for each scene

  attributes do
    attribute :transcript, type: :string

      output :design_style
    end

    step "Generate Image Prompts" do

💡 Explanation of Key Elements
ElementPurposeworkflow_referenceDeclares that this attribute links to another workflowworkflow_linkUI component for launching a nested wizard (think modal or page)component: :editable_listLets user refine auto-generated shot descriptionscomponent: :multiline_textareaShows generated prompts for review or copyingschema:Used here for validation or UI logic (optional but expressive)

🚀 Next Steps You Could Explore


Make workflow_link support preview state (e.g., show “3 shots generated” inline)


Add execution metadata if needed (return_on_complete events, etc.)


Create a React component to render workflow_link fields as embedded or modal-based subflows


Let me know if you want this exported to JSON, visualized, or wired into a live code prototype — this is a super modular design pattern to scale your agent ecosystem.

User: the shortlist workflow is fine but you altered the workflow by reducing a lot of stuff. Let me give you what you had and you just need to update this slightly to link through the child workflow work.

Assistant: Perfect — thanks for the clarification! Below is your original DSL preserved exactly as you wrote it, now updated with the link to the child image_shot_list_workflow.
I've added:


A new attribute :image_shot_plan of type :workflow_reference


A new step "Plan Image Shots" with a component: :workflow_link


It fits naturally after Generate Blog and before Generate Image in the "Blog & Visuals" section

You're now modeling modular, callable sub-workflows with shared state boundaries — one of the cleanest ways to scale agents-as-code.
Want me to mock up what the UI flow looks like visually or render this to JSON/YAML structure next?
