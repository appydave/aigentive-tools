Next Steps
Generate the social media posts needed to promote your new blog article, and then generate a video teleprompter script. Record your video and you are ready to roll!

User: can you describe to me what you think this document is about?

Assistant: Absolutely! This document appears to be a step-by-step workflow guide for using AI (likely ChatGPT or a similar tool) to generate high-quality, SEO-rich blog content, and then repurpose that content for broader digital marketing use.
Here's a breakdown of what it covers:

üß† Purpose
To help users:


Generate blog post ideas


Research and write optimized blog content


Create supporting assets like images and social media posts


Repurpose that content for maximum reach (e.g. video scripts)



‚úçÔ∏è Main Sections (Across the Two Approaches)
1. Generate Inspiration


Start by priming the bot.


Use journalistic-style prompts to brainstorm relevant topics for a target audience.


2. Research


Choose one topic and request the bot to research and list key highlights.


Use prompts to guide the AI in digging deeper into the selected subject.


3. Write a Blog


Ask the bot to write a blog post (600‚Äì1000 words).


Include elements like:


Credible sources and quotes


SEO-rich keywords with hyperlinks


An engaging structure: headline, summary, key takeaways


Clear, non-fluffy language




4. Alternate Approach Using Google Research


Use Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeople also asked‚Äù feature to identify common questions.


Incorporate these into the blog post along with SEO and product links.


Emphasizes natural, question-driven content creation.


5. Image Creation


Prompt the bot (or another tool) to generate a high-res, eye-catching image for the blog post.


Acknowledge that generated images may still be hit-or-miss.


6. Next Steps / Repurposing


Use the blog post as a springboard for:


Social media posts


Video scripts


TikTok, Reels, etc.




Encourages recording videos using a teleprompter script for consistency.



üß∞ Use Case
Ideal for:


Content creators


Marketing teams


Solo entrepreneurs


Anyone using AI to streamline content workflows


It‚Äôs like a content creation playbook, blending SEO best practices, AI prompts, and multimedia repurposing‚Äîall aimed at boosting visibility and engagement. Want help turning this into an automated workflow?

User: So yes you are correct. This is called a prompt pack or a prompt chain and it's been developed by a marketing expert who may or may not fully understand the best way to introduce concepts like variables and when I look at the document I see that there are the instructions for the bot or steps along the way. I can also see wherever it says check-in that there's a period in time in which the human would either accept the values or have a bit of a conversational refinement. I guess there's also areas where information is selected but it's not clear from the placeholders. What the names of those placeholders would be so what I think might be nice is if you give me a structure that can you show me the prompts and give me a tiny little bit of information around the rule is it the human? Is it the bot and what the human in the loop experience might be? Is it feeling a field or is it just going to a bit of conversation mode before moving on?

Assistant: Perfect, you're thinking about this in exactly the right way ‚Äî like a system designer or prompt engineer. What you‚Äôre describing is a Prompt Chain with human-in-the-loop (HITL) moments, placeholders, and alternating roles. So let me break it down into a structured format that shows:


Prompt or Action Step


Role ‚Äî Bot or Human


Human-in-the-loop (HITL) mode ‚Äî Conversation, Selection, Approval, etc.


Placeholder(s) ‚Äî and whether they need to be named or templated



üîó Structured Prompt Chain Breakdown
üü£ Step 1: Prime Your Bot


Prompt: "If you are starting a new chat, complete the bot primer and paste it in to prime your bot."


Role: Human


HITL Mode: Manual input (copy/paste primer)


Placeholders: None here, but primer can include custom variables like brand tone, audience, etc.



üü£ Step 2: Topic Research


Prompt: "Act as an investigative journalist, and suggest 5 topics that my target audience would be most interested in reading about this month."


Role: Bot


HITL Mode: Human selects from the list or refines in conversation


Placeholders: Could use [target audience] to be more explicit



üü£ Step 3: Check-in


Prompt: "Wait for your bot to respond. Check that they have understood what you need, and adjust instructions if needed."


Role: Human


HITL Mode: Conversational refinement, soft validation


Placeholders: None



üü£ Step 4: Highlight Research


Prompt:
"Taking number [] above, can you do some research and write 10 key highlights about []. Please write the highlights as a numbered list."


Role: Bot


HITL Mode: Human selects which topic number; bot returns structured list


Placeholders: [topic number], [subject] ‚Äî both should be clearly defined



üü£ Step 5: Check-in


Prompt: Same as above


Role: Human


HITL Mode: Quality check, iterative prompt refinement


Placeholders: None



üü£ Step 6: Blog Writing


Prompt:
"Taking number [____] above, can you write an informative 600-word blog post on the topic? Please include quotes from reputable sources as well as SEO-rich keywords..."


Role: Bot


HITL Mode: Human ensures tone, SEO, format is right


Placeholders: [topic number], possibly [style], [CTA], [source preferences]



üü£ Step 7: Final Check-in


Prompt: "Wait for your bot to respond. Check the quality of the blog post..."


Role: Human


HITL Mode: Review, rewrite request, or accept


Placeholders: None



üîÅ Alternate Path: SEO with Google Data
üü† Google Research Start


Prompt: "Start with a keyword phrase... copy the top 5 'People Also Asked' questions into your bot..."


Role: Human


HITL Mode: Copy-paste from Google


Placeholders: [keyword phrase], [people also asked questions]



üü† SEO Article Prompt


Prompt:
"Please write an SEO optimised article on [topic]... Answer the following questions: [insert PAA]... Include links to [products or references]..."


Role: Bot


HITL Mode: Human just supplies content, reviews outcome


Placeholders: [topic], [PAA questions], [links], [CTA]



üü† Image Generation


Prompt: "Generate a suitable high resolution eye-catching image..."


Role: Bot


HITL Mode: Optional visual selection


Placeholders: [image topic], can be inferred or specified



üü† Next Steps


Prompt: "Generate social media posts, create video script, record teleprompter..."


Role: Bot (generate) + Human (record)


HITL Mode: Prompt reuse + media production


Placeholders: [platform], [style], [length]



üß© Suggestions for Improvement


Add Placeholder Naming: e.g., [target_audience], [topic_focus], [seo_keywords] ‚Äî better variable control


Role Tags: Label each step for clarity ‚Äî HUMAN, BOT, BOT + HUMAN


Field Forms for Selection: Some steps could be streamlined with a form-style interface (e.g., choose from generated list)


Prompt Type Tagging: For example:


[RESEARCH_PROMPT]


[GENERATION_PROMPT]


[CHECKPOINT]


[USER_DECISION]





Would you like me to turn this into a reusable prompt chain template or editable table format you can build from?

User: So we're going to collect some variables still on the way yes I would like a [target audience] variable and I would also like a primer variable but I'm going to call it [fact_sheet].

From a variable point of view when we are doing the refinement in step number three what are we refining? Have we got an output variable for this?

Does insert PAA mean [other_faqs], is links meant to be seperated as list of products &/or sites]

CTA shoudl be both message & link as variables

I feel like when you wrote the instructions for the place write an SEO optimise article you didn't give me the full prompt that was in the screenshot. Let me know if you need that again.

Assistant: Awesome ‚Äî this is exactly the kind of thoughtful structuring that turns a basic prompt chain into a modular, scalable content system. Let's go step by step through your questions and upgrades.

‚úÖ 1. Variables to Capture
Base Variables (declared at start or early in the workflow)


[target_audience] ‚Äî Who the content is for


[fact_sheet] ‚Äî The initial context, primer, brand voice, tone, and rules


As content progresses:


[selected_topic] ‚Äî Topic chosen by human from the list of 5


[topic_number] ‚Äî Optional index reference to the above


[research_highlights] ‚Äî 10-point list, can be stored as output variable


[blog_post] ‚Äî Full SEO-rich blog article


[other_faqs] ‚Äî Formerly ‚Äúinsert PAA‚Äù (People Also Asked)


[link_products] ‚Äî List of product URLs to be linked in blog


[link_references] ‚Äî Supporting sites/articles to be linked


[cta_message] ‚Äî The actual call to action copy


[cta_link] ‚Äî The offer/landing page link


‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî we can treat links as two variables:


[link_products]


[link_references]


‚úÖ And yes ‚Äî CTA should be split into:


[cta_message]


[cta_link]



‚úÖ 2. What are we refining in Step 3 (Check-in after Topics)?
Great observation. In Step 3, the human is reviewing the list of 5 suggested topics. So:


The output variable from the bot is: [topic_list]


The refined variable is: [selected_topic] or [topic_number]


That check-in is where the user:


Clarifies or refines the topic suggestion


Picks one for deep dive


Optionally re-prompts if the topics aren‚Äôt relevant


We can explicitly define this step as:

Refine [topic_list] to create [selected_topic]


‚úÖ 3. Prompt Correction ‚Äî ‚ÄúPlease write an SEO optimized article‚Ä¶‚Äù
You're right. I summarized earlier but let‚Äôs extract the full original prompt from the screenshot (image 3). Here's the exact version, cleaned for clarity and with variables:

SEO Article Prompt (Full Version with Variable Tags)
vbnetCopyEditPlease write an SEO optimised article on [selected_topic].

Please answer the following questions in your article:  
[other_faqs]

Include anchored text keyword hyperlinks within the text to the following:  
- Products: [link_products]  
- References: [link_references]

Include a compelling CTA message: [cta_message]  
Include a CTA link: [cta_link]

Please write the blog post, making sure it is 600‚Äì1000 words long and is written in an easy-to-read, clear and informative tone.  
Please include appropriate references to credible links.  
Do not include any 'instructional' or meta texts, just provide the final copy.


üß† Next Steps?
I can now:


Turn this into a prompt chain template with all variables shown


Provide a markdown or table version for clarity


Or convert it into a workflow format (e.g. Notion, Airtable, JSON template for automation)


What would be most helpful to you next?

User: Turn this into a prompt chain template with all variables shown

Assistant: Awesome! Here‚Äôs your Prompt Chain Template ‚Äî fully modular, clearly labeled with [variables], and structured with roles and HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) steps.

üß© SEO Blog Prompt Chain Template

Role: Bot
Prompt:

Based on the blog post [blog_post], generate:


3 social media post variations (for [platform])


A video teleprompter script for a short vertical video




Let me know if you'd like:


This in markdown or a downloadable format


An Airtable/Notion layout


A version optimized for a prompt orchestration tool (like FlowGPT, AIPRM, etc.)

User: If I had a later date I needed to turn this into a requirements document one of the things that I don't have enough clarity on in the steps that you've given me is what a human in the loop component would look like and I can see a couple that I have be a field or a drop-down field might be the they may or severe list but they can also be a conversation and the idea of the conversation is ultimately it would go into one of the fields what I think I'd like to see from you inside each one of those steps. Can you tell me the suggested human in the loop component and tell me what you think the button name would say as well if this was a wizard.

Assistant: Brilliant thinking ‚Äî you‚Äôre already halfway to a proper UX + requirements doc for a prompt-powered content wizard. What you‚Äôre asking for is clarity on how each HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) interaction should function in a UI context:


Type of interaction (field, dropdown, chat, etc.)


What it produces (mapped to a variable)


Suggested button text (if this were part of a wizard interface)


Let‚Äôs walk through it step-by-step with those layers added üëá

Would you like this turned into a figma-style mockup, markdown spec, or JSON wizard config next?

User: Canvas Great I want you to keep this in this descriptive document structure were not yet doing a requirements document but everything you've included has been spot on. I think the one thing that's missing is I don't have a detailed list of prompts with each step so I'd like you to finish off this documentincluding the prompts. I'd also like you to give me some nice marketing friendly title for the application or tool

Assistant: All set! The full structured document is now on the canvas under the title SmartContent Wizard. It includes variables, human-in-the-loop types, prompts, and button labels for each step in the flow.
Want me to move this toward a formal requirements doc, a user flow map, or even mock up a basic interface next?

User: This is great we're going. Let's leave this document alone. We're moving onto new research and we will refer to this document later. Are you ready?

Assistant: Absolutely, I'm ready‚Äîlet's dive into the new research!

User: At the moment, I just want to give you some additional context https://aigentive.ai/

AI Integration Platform
Build, deploy, and manage intelligent Workflows & AI Agents

This tool has an SDK which will allow me to build out the AI agents. We're not too concerned about that right now. I think the other thing is that does AI workflows when they're created can be communicated with using a front end application and you might create that application using react and shad CN components, think of it as having AI as a back end with some sort of rest API communicating to it from the front end.

So whenever we're doing a particular task like filling in the fat sheet there is both the data that goes through to the workflow engine. There's maybe a few there's the user interface for that particular page and they may need to be a little bit of state for information as to whether it's just send the information and keep doing other parts the workflow or whether it's a human in the loop operation I think for this application most of them are human in the loop operations at every point and what I want you now to consider is what would we need to put into a requirement document to execute on this goal and that doesn't mean going write the requirements document just yet just tell me what you think we need to consider

Assistant: Got it ‚Äî you're setting up for a highly interactive AI-driven application where human-in-the-loop (HITL) interactions are core, powered by AIGENTIVE as the workflow/agent backend, and React + shadcn as the frontend.
You‚Äôre not building yet ‚Äî just preparing to scope the requirements document. So let‚Äôs think strategically about what needs to be considered and captured before writing that.

üß† What to Include in the Requirements Document for This AI Workflow App
Here‚Äôs a structured list of categories and elements you'd want to include:

1. Project Overview


High-level goals and purpose of the application


Core value proposition (e.g. ‚ÄúAI-powered content creation with human refinement‚Äù)


Brief intro to the tech stack: AIGENTIVE + React + shadcn/ui



2. System Architecture Overview


Backend: AIGENTIVE workflow/agent orchestration via SDK or REST API


Frontend: React with state management (likely something like Zustand or Redux)


Communication: API layer to send data to workflows and receive agent responses


State management logic (e.g., when to pause, wait, display modals, resume)



3. User Experience (UX) Flow


Screens/pages representing each step in the prompt chain


Expected user actions per page (e.g. fill in, choose, review, revise)


UI patterns: inputs, dropdowns, previews, cards, stepper/wizard component


Inline editing vs modal-driven review


Navigation logic: linear vs branching (based on responses)



4. Human-in-the-Loop Logic


Flag per step: isHITL = true/false


Determine pause/resume behavior:


Does the AI wait for input?


Can user skip or delay?




Expected interaction types:


Simple field entry (text, dropdown, multi-select)


Decision-making (select from list)


Review & confirm (text preview, accept/rewrite)





5. Frontend Components
For each UI step (e.g., Fill Fact Sheet, Choose Topic, etc.):


Component name


Inputs/props expected


Expected interactions


Output/return value


Trigger points (e.g., when to send to API)


You might scaffold:
tsxCopyEdit<ComponentName>
Inputs: [fact_sheet]
UI Elements: TextArea + Save Button
Action: Send to AIGENTIVE API
State: Wait for response / Proceed


6. API Interactions


API routes and payload formats (REST or SDK abstraction)


Input schema per step (variables and metadata)


Output schema (bot-generated content, errors, state, etc.)


Error handling and fallback behavior



7. State & Data Flow


State per page (inputs, validations, API status)


Global session state (which step are we on, what‚Äôs completed?)


Temporary storage (e.g., local cache vs DB)


Data to persist between sessions (e.g., draft progress)



8. Workflow Agent Configuration


Which agent/workflow does each step call?


Agent naming conventions (e.g., generate_topics, write_blog)


Required variables per agent


Reusability of agents between steps or flows



9. Validation & Edge Cases


Input validation (e.g., required fields, format checks)


AI failure scenarios (timeout, irrelevant output)


Manual override paths


Steps that support user-supplied content vs bot-generated



10. Permissions & Roles (Optional Future Scope)


Admin vs user content


Who can edit, approve, publish


Save as draft / Submit for review



11. Analytics & Feedback


Capture usage data per step


Track revisions, retries, confirmations


Feedback loop on bot-generated content quality



12. Branding & Theming


Support for white-labeled UI (if relevant)


ShadCN component customization


Fonts, colors, logos



üß© Recap: You‚Äôll Want to Define...


The data model for each step (inputs/outputs/variables)


The UI component structure and flow


The HITL behavior per step


The API contracts to/from AIGENTIVE


The state logic and transitions


The workflow agent bindings


The user‚Äôs journey end-to-end



Would you like me to turn this into a living checklist or planning table? Or take one part (like HITL behavior) and start drafting a requirements section?

User: When we do the front end react stack. We don't want to mention what it'll be to the developers because they'll do what they want so we don't need to be opinionated here just that we have need of a front hand done in react.

State and data flow is not something I want to talk about too much in the requirements document. I'll let the developers figure that out validation and cases is also something that I won't be specifying it all. Just use the default validation rules of the component that we actually select permissions and roles are out of scope because this is a minimum viable product. Analytics and feedback is out of scope and branding and theme should be default.

Assistant: Perfect ‚Äî your scope is becoming crystal clear. Here‚Äôs how we can refine and slim down the list for your MVP-oriented requirements document, respecting your boundaries:

‚úÖ What's IN Scope for the Requirements Document
These are the key areas you'll want to specify clearly to support execution:
1. Project Overview


Purpose of the app (AI-guided content creation)


Core workflow: Human-AI collaboration


Stack alignment:


Backend: AIGENTIVE workflows/agents (via SDK or API)


Frontend: Built in React, no further opinion on implementation




Target outcome: Seamless human-in-the-loop interaction per prompt chain step



2. UX Flow


Define each screen/page as a discrete wizard step


For each step:


User action (e.g., ‚ÄúFill out fact sheet‚Äù)


Expected UI component(s) (TextArea, dropdown, cards, etc.)


Variable(s) collected (e.g., [fact_sheet])


Action trigger (e.g., ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù, ‚ÄúNext Step‚Äù)


What happens next (send to agent, wait for response, etc.)





3. Human-in-the-Loop Interactions


Each step should indicate whether it is:


A pure form entry (e.g., text input)


A decision point (e.g., pick from list, approve content)


A refinement flow (e.g., ask AI to revise content)




Define button labels and expected response flow (e.g., when the UI should pause for AI)



4. Variable Mapping


Clear list of input/output variables used throughout the workflow


Map which variable is used in which step


Clarify if it‚Äôs user-supplied, AI-generated, or both



5. Agent Binding


For each step, define:


The name of the AIGENTIVE workflow or agent being called


The input variables sent


The expected output format




You don‚Äôt need to define the agent logic ‚Äî just the integration contract



‚ùå What's OUT of Scope for the Requirements Document
The following areas will not be included in your MVP requirements:


‚ùå Frontend architecture decisions (state, routing, structure, etc.)


‚ùå Validation rules beyond the default component behaviors


‚ùå Permissions, user roles, or authentication logic


‚ùå Analytics, tracking, or usage metrics


‚ùå Custom branding or theming (use default shadcn/ui styles)



Would you like me to now start drafting a requirements document shell using this refined scope ‚Äî or do you want to first lock down the agent-to-UI mapping across the full flow (using our SmartContent Wizard as the base)?

User: Yes

Assistant: The SmartContent Wizard ‚Äì MVP Requirements Document is now live on the canvas. It includes your refined scope, each wizard step, human-in-the-loop interactions, agent bindings, and all relevant variables‚Äîlean, clear, and build-ready.
Just let me know when you're ready to move into UI mockups, developer specs, or start linking this into an actual workflow in AIGENTIVE.

User: Can you give me a description of the first two pages in the Wizard and can you make it a little bit distinct from the point of view that I want the first page to feel like a starter page? You're on the start of a journey? Where is the second page? Will be just extra content going through.

Assistant: Absolutely ‚Äî that distinction between a "starter page" and a "working step" is a great design pattern. Here's a clear description for the first two pages of the SmartContent Wizard that captures that intention:

üü¢ Page 1: Welcome & Setup ‚Äì ‚ÄúStart Your Content Journey‚Äù
üéØ Purpose:
To onboard the user, frame the goal of the tool, and collect two essential pieces of foundational information: the fact sheet (primer) and target audience.
‚ú® Tone & Feel:


Warm, inviting, optimistic


Motivational headline like:
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Build Something Brilliant‚Äù
or
‚ÄúStart Your SmartContent Journey‚Äù


Subheadline to guide the user:
‚ÄúTell us a bit about what you do and who you‚Äôre writing for. We‚Äôll take it from there.‚Äù


üß± UI Components:


Multiline TextArea for [fact_sheet]
Label: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your business, tone, or mission?‚Äù


Text input or dropdown for [target_audience]
Label: ‚ÄúWho is this content for?‚Äù


Continue button: Start with these


üß≠ Additional Touches:


Optional progress indicator (Step 1 of 7)


A motivational subtext like:
‚ÄúThis will help guide your AI partner through the rest of the journey.‚Äù


Maybe a playful icon or small animation (optional, low priority)



üü¶ Page 2: Choose a Blog Topic ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat Should We Write About?‚Äù
üéØ Purpose:
To let the AI suggest a few blog topics based on the inputs, and let the user pick the one they want to focus on.
‚ú® Tone & Feel:


Confident and productive


Language like:
‚ÄúHere are some fresh blog ideas tailored to your business.‚Äù


Encourage curiosity and selection


üß± UI Components:


Card or list UI presenting [topic_list] (5 suggestions)


Radio-style selection or highlight state


Continue button: Use this Topic


Optional: ‚ÄúRegenerate Ideas‚Äù button to re-call the agent


üß≠ Additional Touches:


Topic cards might include:


Headline (Topic)


One-sentence rationale (from AI)




A subtle note: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll dive deeper into this topic in the next step.‚Äù



Would you like me to wireframe these two screens visually or keep writing the next set of pages in this format?

User: Canvas Can you do a HTML page for the first page?

Assistant: Your HTML for the SmartContent Welcome Page is now live on the canvas. It's styled with TailwindCSS and ready for integration into your React workflow or further theming. Want to move on to Page 2 or preview this as a live React component?

User: Can you implement the second page of the wizard?

Assistant: Page 2 of the wizard ‚Äî Topic Selection ‚Äî is now implemented and live on the canvas. It includes styled radio-button cards for topic choices and options to regenerate or continue.
Would you like to wire it to real data next, or should we move on to designing Page 3?

User: Can I now see the combined pages that has page one and two with the ability to click between them?

Assistant: The combined HTML for Page 1 and Page 2 of the SmartContent Wizard is now live on the canvas. You can navigate between steps using internal logic, simulating the real flow of the wizard.
Want to continue with Step 3 or integrate real data into these steps next?

User: When I clicked on the button to go to the next slide, it didn't actually work

Assistant: Ah good catch! That‚Äôs likely due to the default form submission behavior preventing the JavaScript function from triggering properly.
Let me fix it by making sure the onsubmit function both prevents default behavior and correctly targets the function to switch steps. I‚Äôll also make sure the step change is robust across browsers. Updating now...

Assistant: All fixed! The navigation between Step 1 and Step 2 should now work as expected ‚Äî clicking ‚ÄúStart with these‚Äù will correctly advance the wizard. Ready to build Step 3 or wire these forms into your workflow next?

User: Create image Can you draw a beautiful image of page one of the Wizard?
